As we have seen as the huge data numpy is slow.
we have best version of array==>tensor
for tensor we need module tensorflow.
It uses graph behind the scene.
like we use the previous results in compitetive programming.(optimizing recurssion)(can see it as neuron)
(lazzy execution) all new languages use this concept.
In this we only can some expression to run if and onky if we call it.
like
c = a*b-1
after 10 line
print c#now we will execute te above expression.

lambda is type of lazy execution.

we can create var or constant in tensorflow


@tf.function
def lw(a,b):
    c = a*b+1
    d = a*b*3
    print c
    print d

a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(6)
lw(a,b)


finding the best weoght and ias for the model is know as emperical risk minimization.
loss_function = (y - y')^2
