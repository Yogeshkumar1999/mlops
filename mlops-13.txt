we learn about the tensorflow and keras.
explaing the how name came from neurins.
#Y iu ahvemt goit error while i am processing the bg file in lsh
we can use generoter for yileding the line from huge fule
f = open("file")
def fun():
    yield f.read(1024)

deep learning id not only for classification we can use it for regression also
we have lot of activation functions in deep learning-relu, softmax, sigmoid, tanh etc;
the output for the regression is onr neuron.
for regression we ned to use linear activation fuinction.
we need to get the values of the w in any machiune learning model.
in deep learning we have auto feature sleection.
intially it pick some random weight and statrt the programm.
always select random weights near zero.
y - y' is loss
the x and y is constant should be(constants)
we can change the bias and the weight in neurons.(Variables)
we need to min the error(loss).
back propagation:
#####8<F9#how can i see the ouptu in my phone.
#####in back prop[agation if netweork is deep then the backpropagation for first layer is very very low how to slove.
####gradient descent will checkt eh whole loss on al the data and then prform the slop(epochs)
where as the sgd it will random take any record and perform the slop with tha loss of that record.

optimizer(gd, sgd, mini dg).

@@@@activation function is for calculating the slope.
