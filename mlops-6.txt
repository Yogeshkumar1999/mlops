(feature selection in machine learning
To learn what are the best features for the model to train in order to increase the accuracy if the model and to norow down the variables.
it will help ful when we have lot of independent varables to rain the
in some cases these un wanted variable might decreae the accuracy of the mdoel.
MAIN AND TUMB RULE TO REMOVE A COLUMN IF ALL THE VALUES IN THE COLUM IS SAME JUST REOMVE IT.👍️


every independent column variable is know an features😊️.
DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE HELPS A LOT FOR FEATURE SELECTION.

Main Step In Ml Is Finding The Y And X.

two ways to do feature selection
1. manually(domain expert)(slow)
2. trough code ==> (filter, wrapper method, embeded method)(fast)
neuarl nets helps us more on feture selction use wraper method.
lasso (l1 regularization) helps in feature selection.

data collection plays major role to create a good model.
filter_methos(feature selection):
	(collage name, id, duration, marks, country(lot of variance))
	y collage is not good.

	
programm
	1.try correlation methide we get the corrlation between two featuers will help us to select the feature or to elemenate.
	2. 95-99 as quasi constant(variane).
	3. cal visualise in heat map.
	4. useless featueres can also use more resources.


	(COLLECT RIGHT DATA, HUGE DATA, FEATURE SELCTION.)MAJOR THREE PARTS IN ML.

MULTILINEAR REGRESSION:
	example price of the house using income, bedrooms, rooms, population, income, age of house).
	MAIN ml understands only numerial data.
	HOW ABOUT SEEIN THE R2 SCORE(we check score by adding the featres one by one or delete one by one).
