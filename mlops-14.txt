we will learn matplotlib
data visualization:
if we have any data ad to know th some kind of pattern we can wee the daat visualization.
we draw the past data in this.
matplotlib.
seaborn.
plt.scatter, plt.line. plt.histogram, plt.bar, plt.pie.

data of gps coordinates to visualise best way ia map.

folium libaray
pip install folium.
create as dataset of lat and long.
lmap = folium.Map(location = [25.34523, 25.345325], zoom_start = 13)
folium.Marker(location = [25.34523, 25.345325], popup = 'yogesh worl', icon = folium.icon).add_to(lmap)
print lmap

#openstreetmap is open source.
we have diffenent style of the mpa in ther map function().
#search for folium tiles it support.

we have lot of options in the .Marker and the Map function see and enjoy.

we can do live trACKING IN FOLIUM.
in computer vison;:inriiv2 ace detection using harr cascade we hasve wrights pre trainerd.
for collecting right time it woll takie lot of time.
preptrained model he,ps us alot.
for big dta ue the nn.
for regression , classfication w use the normal ANN.
for images and videos use the CNN.
for time series dta use the RNN.
we have different cnn
RCNN, FRCNN, yolo.
we pre created weight of the yolo.
YOLO:
if we want object detection we can use ore-tra8ned model.
3 versions of the yolo we use version 3 of yolo.
yolo:you only look ones.(trained on the pascal titan X )and has the 30fps.
imagenet is fr images.
coco datsetis smalle than tyhe imageet.(image quality is good.)
coco has 80 diff objects.
if imagenet they have 100+ objects can detect.
we need to download the weogtts from web
yolo built under thr frame work darknet.
how to setup yoloV3.
go to yolo.yml dir
create envi.
conda env create -f yolo.yml.
to run the program 
python detect.py
--det dog/dog.jpg
video-demo, cam-demo.py
xaevir is the method tp init the weights.
