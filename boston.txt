filter(lambda, sequemce)

ex:
l = [1,234,45,21]
filter(lambda x:x%2 == 0, l)
Map takes all objects in a list and allows you to apply a function to it whereas Filter takes all objects in a list and runs that through a function to create a new list with all objects that return True in that function. Hence, knowing the functionality and using it accordingly is important as both the functions have very minute difference in there functionality.
