#doubt fitting it with unseen data.


Revised the feature elimination, finding the coeff_ to check the importance of the feature.
weight is the every thing in the machine learning.
OLS(model)###need to learn about it>>>>>
Model performance depends upon the on of features.
p value < 0.05 is vimp.(help to eliminate the feature)
P-Value:
    1. Topic of statistical element.
    2. we have null and alternative hypo.
    3. probability value(p-value)
    4. need to see the imp of p value


gretl--->software.
p vlaue always thinka null hypo as every thing ia invalid feature
if p vlaue < 5 per we reject the null hypo and accpet the alter native hypo 
which is we need to keep the feature.
A p-value less than 0.05 (typically â‰¤ 0.05) is statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability the null is correct (and the results are random). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis.
