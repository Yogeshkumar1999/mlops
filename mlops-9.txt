we have to do feature selection.
If a fetaure is not atall effecting the futer accuracy its better we remove the feature 
as it will effect the performance of the model.
multi colinearity==> if one independent feature is dependent on other independent feature.
dimensionality reduction:
	1. feature selection
		1. filter(constant, quasi constant, corelation)manual
		2. embedded
		3. wrapper
	2. feature extraction
		1. algo pca(principal component analysis)(we remove duplicates from features)(automation of featur4e elemination)
to get better accuracy and optimization.

feature selection using wrapper methid(use alot):
we need to transform catagorical to numerical using one hot encoding.
pd.get_dummies only convert the catagorical features.

All the x should be independent.
to remove the multi colinearity we use drop_first in pd.get_dummies()
